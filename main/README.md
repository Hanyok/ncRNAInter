##### Hanyu Zhang, Yunxia Wang, Ziqi Pan, Xiuna Sun, Honglin Li and Feng Zhu*
## Dependencies
- RNAInter should be deployed on Linux.
- Dependencies can be installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- To use GPU, please install the gpu version of `dgl` and `pytorch`.
## Usage
### Predict new lncRNA-miRNA interactions using pre-trained models with default datasets
#### For any miRNA or lncRNA user want to investigate, ...
#### For any specific lncRNA-miRNA pair user want to investigate, ...
### Train your own RNAInter with self-defined datasets and predict

##### *Algorithm of RNA feature extraction will update later
